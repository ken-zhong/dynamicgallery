# dynamicgallery ver 0.1 

A simple photo gallery built primarily in Javascript using a canvas element. While not as performant as a CSS carousel, it has the benefit of not requiring any changes to the HTML code to add/remove images from the carousel, as an image array is created automatically from a list of links near the top of the .js file. 

Note: still a WIP, and the thumbnail carousel hasn't been implemented yet.
