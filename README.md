# dynamicgallery ver 0.4 

A simple photo gallery built primarily in Javascript using a canvas element. It has the benefit of not requiring any changes to the HTML code to add/remove images from the carousel, as an image array is created automatically from a list of links near the top of the .js file. Simple animations are easy to add by using canvas methods. Here, I added a simple "zooming out" animation on these landscape images to create a more dynamic feel.
